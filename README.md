# ualberta_thesis_template
A thesis template for master's/doctoral thesis.

 It satisfies the requirements given in https://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/media-library/current-students/academicrequirements/thesisrequirementandpreparation/2016-03-29-fgsrminimumthesisformattingrequirements.pdf.
 
 Might not work with an old LaTeX version. I personally used TeX Live 2021 on Ubuntu. (Overleaf always has the latest version.)
