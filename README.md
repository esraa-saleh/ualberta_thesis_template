# ualberta_thesis_template
A thesis template for master's/doctoral thesis.

 It satisfies the requirements given in https://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/media-library/current-students/academicrequirements/thesisrequirementandpreparation/2016-03-29-fgsrminimumthesisformattingrequirements.pdf.
 
 Might not work with an old LaTeX version. I personally used TeX Live 2021 on Ubuntu. (Overleaf always has the latest version.)

To see how this template looks in completion, you can take a look at my thesis created using this template, available here: https://svmgrg.github.io/documents/alternate_estimator_thesis_2021.pdf.
